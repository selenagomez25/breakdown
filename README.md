# breakdown
breakdown is a disassembler for x86-64 architecture. started to be something educational, made to offer a straightforward way to disassemble x86-64 instructions. however, i soon realized that developing a fully operational and efficient disassembler was more challenging than i thought. as a result, i have chosen to cease active development on breakdown.
